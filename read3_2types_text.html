            that you know the difference between narrative and expository texts, let's take 
            a closer look at the two types of text.</p><p align="LEFT"><span class="redbold">Narrative 
            Text</span> <br> First we are going to examine Narrative Text. Go back to your 
            handouts and read the story, <span class="handount">The Dinner Party</span>. Then, 
            complete the<span class="handount"> Narrative Frame</span> handout. </p><p align="LEFT">Narrative 
            frames require students to identify the most important/crucial information in 
            a story (main idea), the information that students MUST BE ABLE TO RECALL. </p><p align="LEFT"><span class="redbold">Expository 
            Text</span> <br> Now we are going to focus on Expository text. <br>Up to about 
            the third grade most of the material that students are asked to read or that is 
            read to them is narrative. Therefore, when students progress and are expected 
            to read expository text some have difficulty transferring strategies used in reading 
            one type of text to the other. Students have to learn on their own or be taught 
            how to apply reading strategies to the expository text found in science, history, 
            math and other content areas. </p><p align="LEFT">Locate your handout on <span class="handount">Fluency 
            Instruction</span> and the <span class="handount">K-W-L Chart</span>. Read the 
            Fluency article and complete the K-W-L chart. 
            </p><p align="LEFT">The K-W-L chart 
            is an instructional technique that is used to activate students' prior knowledge 
            by asking them what they already <b>Know</b>; then students (as a class or within 
            small groups) set goals specifying what they <b>Want to learn</b>; and after reading 
            students discuss what they have <b>Learned</b>. The three parts of this procedure 
            - brainstorming, establishing purposes through questioning and finding answers 
            to those questions, almost guarantee that students will be actively involved 
            in learning. </p><p align="CENTER"><img src="images/comets.gif" width="207" height="86"></p><center><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="90%" bordercolor="#CCCC99" bgcolor="#EAEAD7"><tbody><tr bgcolor="#CCCC99"><th>Know</th><th>Want

            Text.</span> <br>Considering that most reading required of secondary students 
            is of expository text, <b>it is important that students know and understand how 
            information is structured and presented in such text.</b> Knowing this will allow 
            students to utilize appropriate strategies in identifying important information 
            within the text. Failure to identify such information is a major cause of low 
            comprehension when reading expository text. You as teachers need to know about 
            the different types of expository text in order to alert students about the structure 
            of a paragraph which can dictate what type of information is contained within 
            it. </p><p align="CENTER" class="parahead"><img src="images/readingicons.gif" width="557" height="85"></p><p align="LEFT" class="parahead">Eight
