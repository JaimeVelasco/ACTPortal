            and what causes comprehension lags?</font></b>

            The language experience begins with listening and children beginning to perceive speech sounds during the first year. Next comes speaking, with most children uttering their first word around age one (1). The more listening and speaking interaction children are exposed to the more prepared they will be to begin reading. Reading includes several processes that need to take place at the same time, processes such as recognizing words, assigning meanings to words, constructing the meanings of sentences and larger units and relating the information to information the child already has.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            There is evidence that vocabularies of many children of poverty entering school are much smaller than those of their middle class counterparts. There is also evidence that having a limited vocabulary is detrimental to success in reading.
          </p>
          <p align="left">
            According to the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP) on reading (2002), only 31% of fourth graders can read at a proficient or advanced level. Achievement among the highest-performing students remained stable, and America's lowest performers have improved only slightly. There is a wide achievement gap between poor and more economically advantaged students, as well as between white and minority students.
