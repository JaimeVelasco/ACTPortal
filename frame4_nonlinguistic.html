          The process of storing information through imagery is referred to as nonlinguistic. Although often words and phrases are used in the process, they are used in a <span class="origunder">specific format thereby forming an "image," a form that organizes the words and phrases that facilitates recall</span>, remembering the contained information.

        <p>
          <span class="redbold"><img src="images/question.gif" width="80" height="115" align="left">Why is this necessary?</span> It works because we usually ask students to talk or read about the content we want them to learn. <span class="origunder">Students are often left to develop their own nonlinguistic representations, but mostly they do it haphazardly,</span> which influences learning negatively.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research now tells us that <span class="origunder">when the teacher facilitates the development of nonlinguistic representations with their students</span>, the effect on student <span class="origunder">achievement is strong</span>. Research has also documented an increase in brain activity when stimulated by the creation of nonlinguistic representations.

        <ul>
          <li>This pattern organizer can be used to identify facts about
            <ul>
              <li>specific topics,
              </li>
              <li>persons,

              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For this organizer, sequence is not important, facts can appear anywhere, in any order as they are equally relevant to the topic being described.
          </li>
          <li>Although ovals are shown above, squares, circles, any shape can be used to contain the topic and the fact.
          </li>
          <li>The size can vary depending on the length of the topic and fact.
          </li>
          <li>The idea here is that the student can best remember facts about a topic if MORE than words are used.
          </li>
          <li>The topic becomes an image that can be recalled in an organized way when visually represented instead of just isolated ideas/facts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Think about the word:</b> <span class="redbold">" S A L T "</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>What is the first thing that happened in your mind?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b class="origunder">3 things can happen.</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>You can either recall the word and how it is spelled FIRST OR
          </li>
          <li>You can recall an image of the spelled word, seeing the word in your mind's eye, or you can bring up an image of a salt crystal, or a salt shaker OR
          </li>
          <li>You can conjure up a third image, you can actually have a TASTE reaction, recall a very salty taste.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          More than likely, the last two of the 3 are usually what you recall, an image of a salt crystal or salt shaker, or a taste reaction.
