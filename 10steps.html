The more information that you arm yourself with, the better you are prepared! You will bring your Special Education notebook to the first night of face to face classes, and your information will be graded using a rubric. This rubric is in your handouts, so take a look at what will be expected of you!

          Before we get too deep into Special Education topics, there are some basic terms and concepts that must be understood first. Many times throughout these modules, you will hear references to <strong>ARD's</strong> and <strong>IEP's</strong> along with many other acronyms! Although you will learn about these items in depth during the face to face classes, having a general idea of these concepts will be helpful as you complete these modules!

          The 10 Basic Steps in Special Education 
        </h3>
        <p>
          <img src="images/steps.gif" width="155" height="177" align="right">Children can have all sorts of difficulties growing up. Sometimes problems are obvious right from the start; and sometimes they don't appear until a child is in school.Some children have trouble learning to read or write. Others have a hard time remembering new information. Still others may have trouble with their behavior. For some children, growing up can be very hard to do!
        </p>
        <p>
          When a child is having trouble in school, it's important to find out why. The child may have a disability. By law, schools must provide special help to eligible children with disabilities. This help is called <span class="origunder">special education</span> and <span class="origunder">related services</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Although you will learn much more about this process during the face to face components of Institute, this brief overview is an excellent place to start. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, we've distilled the process into 10 basic steps. Once you have the big picture of the process, it's easier to understand the many details under each step.

                  Child is identified as possibly needing special education and related services.
                </h4>
               <p>
                There are two primary ways in which children are identified as possibly needing special education and related services: the system known as Child Find (which operates in each state), and by referral of a parent or school personnel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Child Find. Each state is required by IDEA to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities in the state who need special education and related services. To do so, states conduct what are known as Child Find activities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a child is identified by Child Find as possibly having a disability and as needing special education, parents may be asked for permission to evaluate their child. Parents can also call the Child Find office and ask that their child be evaluated. 
                </p>
                <p>Referral or request for evaluation. A school professional may ask that a child be evaluated to see if he or she has a disability. Parents may also contact the child's teacher or other school professional to ask that their child be evaluated. This request may be verbal, but it's best to put it in writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Parental consent is needed before a child may be evaluated. Under the federal IDEA regulations, evaluation needs to be completed within 60 days after the parent gives consent. However, if a State's IDEA regulations give a different timeline for completion of the evaluation, the State's timeline is applied.

                  Step 2. Child is evaluated.
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Evaluation is an essential early step in the special education process for a child. It's intended to answer these questions: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Does the child have a disability that requires the provision of special education and related services?</li>
                  <li> What are the child's specific educational needs?</li>
                  <li> What special education services and related services, then, are appropriate for addressing those needs?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By law, the initial evaluation of the child must be "full and individual"-which is to say, focused on that child and that child alone. The evaluation must assess the child in all areas related to the child's suspected disability. 
                </p>
                <p>The evaluation results will be used to decide the child's eligibility for special education and related services and to make decisions about an appropriate educational program for the child. 
                </p>
                <p>If the parents disagree with the evaluation, they have the right to take their child for an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE). They can ask that the school system pay for this IEE.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  A group of qualified professionals and the parents look at the child's evaluation results. Together, they decide if the child is a "child with a disability," as defined by IDEA. If the parents do not agree with the eligibility decision, they may ask for a hearing to challenge the decision.

                  If the child is found to be a child with a disability, as defined by IDEA, he or she is eligible for special education and related services. Within 30 calendar days after a child is determined eligible, the IEP team must meet to write an IEP for the child.

                <p>
                  Many times IEP meetings are also called ARD Meetings -The letters ARD stand for Admission, Review, &amp; Dismissal committee. This is the name of the committee responsible for making the educational decisions for a student. At the ARD meeting, an IEP (Individual Education Plan) is developed that outlines specific goals and objectives for each student to master. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The school system schedules and conducts the IEP meeting. School staff must:

                <ul>
                  <li> contact the participants, including the parents; </li>
                  <li>notify parents early enough to make sure they have an opportunity to attend; </li>
                  <li>schedule the meeting at a time and place agreeable to parents and the school; </li>
                  <li>tell the parents the purpose, time, and location of the meeting; </li>
                  <li>tell the parents who will be attending; </li>
                  <li>and tell the parents that they may invite people to the meeting who have knowledge or special expertise about the child. </li>

                </h4>
                <p>
                  The IEP team gathers to talk about the child's needs and write the student's IEP. Parents and the student (when appropriate) are full participating members of the team. If the child's placement is decided by a different group, the parents must be part of that group as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before the school system may provide special education and related services to the child for the first time, the parents must give consent. The child begins to receive services as soon as possible after the IEP is written and this consent is given. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the parents do not agree with the IEP and placement, they may discuss their concerns with other members of the IEP team and try to work out an agreement. If they still disagree, parents can ask for mediation, or the school may offer mediation. Parents may file a complaint with the state education agency and may request a due process hearing, at which time mediation must be available.
