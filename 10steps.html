        <h1>Early Childhood Education</h1>
        <h4 align="LEFT" class="parahead"><strong>OBJECTIVE:</strong> During this module, you will learn about services that are provided to children ages 0-5. <br clear="all"></h4>
        <p class="origunder">You will need to complete Activity Summary Pages and other related handouts and complete the questions as you go through the session. These notes will serve as a reminder of the material covered during these modules. </p><p>You should go ahead and organize these three topics into a Special Education NOTEBOOK.</p>
        <p align="LEFT"><img src="images/computer.gif" width="85" height="96" align="LEFT">You will be sent to various internet references that will be helpful to you as you prepare to enter into the classroom. Print them out and add them to your notebook! The more information that you arm yourself with, the better you are prepared! You will bring your Special Education notebook to the first night of face to face classes, and your information will be graded using a rubric. This rubric is in your handouts, so take a look at what will be expected of you!</p>
        <p align="LEFT">Before we get too deep into Special Education topics, there are some basic terms and concepts that must be understood first. Many times throughout these modules, you will hear references to <strong>ARD's</strong> and <strong>IEP's</strong> along with many other acronyms! Although you will learn about these items in depth during the face to face classes, having a general idea of these concepts will be helpful as you complete these modules!</p><p align="LEFT" class="parahead">The 10 Basic Steps in Special Education </p><p align="LEFT"><img src="images/steps.gif" width="155" height="177" align="LEFT">Children can have all sorts of difficulties growing up. Sometimes problems are obvious right from the start; and sometimes they don't appear until a child is in school.Some children have trouble learning to read or write. Others have a hard time remembering new information. Still others may have trouble with their behavior. For some children, growing up can be very hard to do!</p><p align="LEFT">When a child is having trouble in school, it's important to find out why. The child may have a disability. By law, schools must provide special help to eligible children with disabilities. This help is called <span class="origunder">special education</span> and <span class="origunder">related services</span>. </p><p align="LEFT">Although you will learn much more about this process during the face to face components of Institute, this brief overview is an excellent place to start. </p><p align="LEFT">Here, we've distilled the process into 10 basic steps. Once you have the big picture of the process, it's easier to understand the many details under each step. </p><p align="LEFT" class="parahead">The 10 Basic Steps in Special Education </p>
