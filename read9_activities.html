    Language Experience Approach
</p>
<p align="left">
    Rationale for LEA - The LEA supports children's concept development and vocabulary growth while offering many opportunities for meaningful reading and writing activities. As such, students, through the LEA, will be able to demonstrate emerging:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>awareness that <b>print conveys meaning</b>
    </li>
    <li>awareness that <b>everyone's thoughts and ideas can be expressed</b> in spoken and written language
    </li>
    <li>ability to <b>gather meaning from reading or listening to others</b> read resources that relate to personal experiences
    </li>
    <li>ability to <b>make meaning known by speaking</b> in informal situations
    </li>
    <li>ability to <b>use listening to understand the meaning</b> and intent of others
    </li>
    <li>ability to <b>tell and retell</b> personal experiences
    </li>
    <li>ability to <b>dictate stories, sentences, and phrases</b> for others to transcribe
    </li>
    <li>ability to <b>understand</b>:
        <blockquote>
            <p class="origunder">
                WHAT I CAN SAY, SOMEONE CAN WRITE DOWN<br>
                WHAT IS WRITTEN DOWN THAT I SAID, CAN BE READ OR SAID
            </p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <span class="redbold">Procedure</span> - The procedure for the LEA can involve the whole class or a small group.

                <b>1. Choose a focus - a wide range of possibilities exist for the creation of language experience reading and writing. These include:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>growing vegetables or flowers in the classroom (Making a "How to Grow Vegetables/Flowers" chart)
                    </li>
                    <li>planning a field trip, taking and writing about it both before and afterward (making lists of things to bring, rules to follow; drawing and labeling a map of where you went; describing the experience)
                    </li>
                    <li>making various kinds of "how to" charts describing experiments the class has done or things they have made
                    </li>
                    <li>making a record of a cultural event such as a Pow-Wow or of the visit of a special guest
                    </li>
                    <li>summarizing a favorite story that children have heard, viewed, or dramatized several times
                    </li>
                    <li>Note: Sometimes occasions for using the LEA arise spontaneously such as an early thunderstorm, experiments with mixing paint, events that capture an event or experience that creates a lot of interest or captures children's imaginations

                <b>2. Demonstrate print concepts as you record the experience.</b> Initially in language experience, it is the teacher or another adult who does the recording (writing on the chart tablet). This is because the approach is intended to demonstrate to children the match between what they say and its written form, and to develop other print concepts. The teacher would draw attention to these aspects of print while writing on chart paper positioned so as to be visible to all the children.

                <b>3. Record children's own language.</b> The most important aspect of recording is to use children's own words, keeping the match between what they say and what you write. Use children's names as much as possible because their own name is one of the first words children learn to recognize. As well, this practice helps to maintain children's connections to the experience in subsequent reading.

                    <span class="redbold">Note</span>: Remember, you cannot record a statement from every child every time you create an LEA record. Stop the discussion and recording before the children lose interest. Pay attention to who has not had an opportunity and include them when you complete this record later in the day, the following day, or the next time you use this approach.

Use your records of the experience for further literacy opportunities.</b> A main purpose of the language experience approach is to provide meaningful texts for students to read either with the support of others or alone. To facilitate this, the record of the experience should be mounted in a prominent place for several weeks following its creation and referred to regularly. Some of the ways the chart, Big Book, etc. can be used include:

    <b>Follow along with your instructor they go through the principles, benefits and characteristics of Guided Reading</b><b>.</b>
</p>
<p>
    <span class="redbold">Guided Reading</span> is a valuable strategy for any level student. As we have discussed earlier, textbooks used in subject areas often include language, vocabulary and concepts specific to a particular field of study. We can't just assign reading. Teachers must help prepare students for and guide them through the texts so that they will learn most effectively.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="parahead"><img src="images/read1.gif" width="70" height="85" align="left">Read Aloud</span><br>
    A <span class="redbold">Read Aloud</span> is a planned oral reading of a book or print usually related to a theme or topic of study. It can be used to model the pleasure of reading and the use of reading strategies and aide in comprehension by motivating students and activating prior knowledge.
</p>
<p>
    <span class="parahead"><br>
    <img src="images/read3.gif" width="91" height="66" align="left">Shared Reading</span><br>
    In Shared Reading, the teacher reads the book aloud on more than one occasion. The first time for enjoyment, the second reading might focus on building and extending comprehension through interaction with students.
</p>
<p>
    Although Leslie's examples are for an elementary class, visuals are for everyone. Think about what catches your eye. Your students are most definitely attracted to visuals, whether it's to introduce or to teach a topic.

    <span class="parahead"><img src="images/readlamp.gif" width="97" height="78" align="left">SSR</span><br>
    <span class="redbold">Sustained Silent Reading</span> - SSR has many forms and names, but generally it is a fixed time period for silent reading during class. It usually requires at least 20 minutes a day in which students read self-selected material silently with no monitoring or other classroom assignments.

<p>
    <b>Here are some other names for SSR:</b>
