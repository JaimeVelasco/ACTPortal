        <h3>Meeting the needs of Diverse Learners</h3>
        <p>Your classroom will be a cultural microcosm.</p>  
          <ul>
            <li>You willhave students that perform <u>on</u> grade level, <u>below</u> grade leabove</u>grade level.</li>
            <li>You willhave students with learning disabilities, physical impairments, and emotionalbaggage.</li>
            <li>You willhave students that come from every socio-economic level.</li>
            <li>You mayhave students that are exposed daily to multiple languages.</li>
            <li>You willbe expected to demonstrate academic gains for each and every student in yourclassroom.</li>
          </ul>

          <h1 align="center">How do you reach them all?</h1>

          <p align="center"><img width="172" height="144" id="Picture 12" src="images/image001.png" alt=""></p>
          <h3 align="center">You need to develop a bag of tricks and strategies to be<br> able to work with a diverse student population.</h3>

          <p>In
          this section, we will outline 3 populations of diverse learners that you will
          encounter as a classroom teacher:</p>
          <ul style="list-style:decimal">
          <li>English Language Learners / Bilingual Education</li>
          <li>Gifted and Talented</li>
          <li>Dyslexia</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Throughout
          institute, you will learn, practice, and observe many teaching strategies to
          promote student success. It is important to understand that many times, it
          takes <b><u>multiple strategies</u></b> to see the light bulb click on! Pay
          attention to all the tricks and techniques that you observe - you will need
          them all.</p>

          <p>We
          also spend some time in this section outlining Differentiated Instruction -
          which simply put - is another technique that you can use to break down the
          curriculum to make it understandable to all students.</p>

          <p>Keep
          in mind that the information that you learn in institute is not all
          encompassing - we scratch the surface, plant the seeds and give you basic
          tools to implement in your class to have success with your students. As a
          professional, you are expected to research and expand on your "tools" to
          increase student success.</p>

          <p>In 2007, the state approved Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills for addressing students that are English language learners (ELLS).</p>

          <p>These
          proficiency standards are designed to assist students in social and academic
          language proficiency in English.</p>
          <ul style="list-style:disc">
          <li>In
          Activity 10, you will have the opportunity to review the English Language
          Proficiency standards.</li>
          <li>You will
          create a CIT to remind you of the variety of techniques that make content
          comprehensible for all students.</li>
          <li>Content
          Sheltered Instruction (the S.I.O.P model - Activity 7) is a great technique to
          make difficult texts easily comprehensible.</li>
          <li>Scaffolding
          in Activity 10 describes a method to facilitate instruction that builds on what
          students already know.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>How
            are kids identified as English Language Learners / Bilingual?</h3>
          <p>Students who
          indicate a language other than English on their Home Language Survey are tested
          for speaking, reading, writing and listening proficiency, such as an IPT test,
          which determines their English proficiency level. A student is placed in the
          most appropriate class by a Language Proficiency Assessment Committee with
          parental approval.</p>

          <p>If the student is
          in elementary school, he or she is placed in the bilingual program. There is no
          bilingual program in middle or high school in Texas, so the secondary student
          has English as a Second Language (ESL) one or two periods a day, and is in regular classes for the remainder
          of the day.</p>

          <p align="center">
          <img width="229" height="187" id="Picture 19" src="images/image005.png"></p>

          <p>Bilingual classes are researched based and
          instruction is in the student's native language for the core subject areas of
          language arts, science, math, social studies and health with structured and
          sequenced mastery of English language development. This is considered the best
          practice in language learning because students can learn new concepts in their
          own language and transition that knowledge to English as language develops.
          Students build a broad educational background that successfully transfers to
          English when the student masters the new language.</p>

          <p><b>ESL</b> students are instructed in English.
          The secondary student has ESL one or two periods a day.Strategies and
          modifications are used to assist students with understanding the course work in
          all classes. ESL classes work best with older students that have some
          knowledge of the English language.</p>

          <p>Middle School
          students typically take ESL in place of English Language Arts. They study the
          same curriculum as the English Language Arts classes, but are instructed by
          teachers trained to use strategies and modifications to help students learn
          English at the same time. </p>

          <p>In high
          school, students begin to earn credits. Non- English speaking immigrant
          students may take English for Speakers of other Languages (ESOL) in place of
          English I and English 2. Students study literature, language and composition
          writing as well as learn how to speak English.</p>

          <p>Each
          spring, all Limited English Proficient (LEP) students take the RPTE (Reading Proficiency Test in English).
          They will be rated either beginning, intermediate, advanced, or advanced high.
          Their listening, speaking, reading and writing skills are also assessed using
          the Observational Protocol, which is completed by the ESL or Language Arts
          teacher in the spring. No Child Left Behind requires that states measure not
          only LEP students' academic progress, but also English language acquisition.</p>

          <h3>TIPS for working with
            English Language Learners*:</h3>
          <p>In order to teach
          English Language Learners (ELLs), teachers need to understand the principles of
          teaching students from other cultures and also the strategies and methods to use to assure
          students' success. Here are 10 tips for working with English Language Learners.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">1.</b> <b style="color:green">Understand your own culture and cultural biases.</b>Unconsciously, educators often
          say things and act based on their own cultural perspectives, which are often attributed to their family upbringing,
          religion, or education. Teachers assume everyone understands their words and actions the way
          they want them to be interpreted. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Words and gestures have different meanings and interpretations in different cultures. Once teachers
          understand their own culture and biases, they can begin to understand others.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">2.</b> <b style="color:green">Get to know your students' cultures. </b>Through technology and the Internet, teachers now have the world
          literally at their fingertips. Read about the culture of the non-native English
          speakers and try to understand why they interact and behave the way they do.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">3.</b> <b style="color:green">Be aware of the levels of acculturation. </b>ELLs pass through levels of acculturation as they adjust to the
          American way of life. Culture shock is a common stage, and teachers must
          understand that students may pass through a silent period or show anger, fatigue,
          or lack of motivation. Being patient and supportive are keys to helping
          students overcome culture shock.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">4. </b> <b style="color:green">Involve the parents. </b>Provide an
          interpreter when possible. Keep the lines of communication open and invite
          parents to share their cultural heritage and participate in activities such as
          field trips and career days. Listen to parents' concerns regarding their
          children's education.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">5.</b> <b style="color:green"> Prepare your classroom to be a multicultural community. </b>Include books, pictures, bulletin boards, and other resources from
          the ELLs' home cultures. Encourage cooperative group work with clear ground
          rules for acceptance of all students.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">6.</b> <b style="color:green"> Provide opportunities for ELLs to learn basic interpersonal
          communication skills. </b>It takes at least two years for ELLs to learn English
          communication skills. Provide opportunities for students to work in flexible
          groups, work with partners, and socialize with peers. Encourage friendships
          between ELLs and English-speaking students.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">7. </b> <b style="color:green">Help ELLs acquire Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency
          (CALP). </b>This is the language needed to understand and perform school tasks.
          CALP can take five or more years to develop. Teach vocabulary explicitly; use
          visual aids and realia; incorporate a variety of graphic organizers; use pre-,
          during, and post-reading strategies to aid with comprehension; and allow more
          time for ELLs to complete content area assignments and projects.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">8. </b> <b style="color:green">Incorporate the multiple intelligences that Howard Gardner
          describes. </b>ELLs have many talents and abilities. Incorporating music,
          movement, art, opportunities for linguistic and mathematical development, and opportunities
          for interpersonal interaction and intrapersonal reflection can unleash those
          talents and support their learning processes.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">9. </b> <b style="color:green">Use appropriate assessments. </b>Paper and
          pencil tests are not always appropriate assessments. Students often do not
          understand the words on the test or understand the format of taking such a
          test. Embed evaluations in instructional activities and scaffold assessments to
          provide support. Provide opportunities for authentic assessments such as
          portfolios, literature response journals, discussion groups, oral interviews,
          and role-playing or simulations. Provide rubrics so students are aware of the
          criteria for evaluation.</p>

          <p><b style="color:red;">10 </b> <b style="color:green">Have high but realistic expectations. </b>Students will achieve what educators expect of them. Keep in mind
          that like all learners, ELLs can and will learn and develop at their own pace.
          Avoid stereotypes, embrace diversity, and celebrate the learning and progress that
          occurs.</p>

          to check it out!</p>

          <p>Most
          districts go through a 3 step process: nomination, screening, and selection.</p>

          <p><b><i>Nomination</i></b> - Nominations may be
          obtained from any person familiar with the students abilities, potential,
          performance or school records.</p>

          <p><b><i>Screening</i></b> - Written permission from
          parents/ guardians is required and students will be screened using a variety of
          testing instruments that will give them an opportunity to demonstrate their
          diverse talents and abilities.</p>

          <p><b><i>Selection - </i></b>After the screening process is complete, a selection committee, made up of G/T coordinators, teachers, and administrators review all testing information. Students identified for G/T score around the upper 5% of the district population.Placement into G/T program is decided by the committee as they review the most effective way to meet the identified needs of the students.</p>

               that go beyond material covered in the regular education classroom. This
               will offer variety and stimulation, while utilizing their higher level
               thinking and problem-solving skills. For example, accelerated readers

               them "more of the same," give them the option of writing a story
               that parallels the classroom reading. Make sure the gifted students see
               these activities as rewards and not punishments for being intelligent.</li>

               written language), visual-spatial (recognition of patterns and space),
               musical (music patterns and composition), logical-mathematical (analyzing
               and deducing), body-kinesthetic (use of body to solve problems),
               interpersonal (understanding others) and intrapersonal (understanding
               self). Incorporating activities into the academic curriculum that involve
               these kinds of intelligence will ensure students are challenged. For
               example, during a reading lesson on Shakespeare, act out a play (kinesthetic),

          <h3 class="box">Dyslexia</h3>

          <p><strong>What
            is dyslexia?</strong><br>
            Dyslexia is a specific learning disability that is
            neurological in origin.It is characterized by difficulties with accurate
            and/or fluent word recognition and by poor spelling and decoding abilities.These
            difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of
            language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and
            the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may
            include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that
            can impede growth of vocabulary and background knowledge (International
            Dyslexia Association, 2002).</p>

          <p>The
          state of Texas defines dyslexia as a disorder of constitutional origin
          manifested by a difficulty in learning to read, write, or spell, despite
          conventional instruction, adequate intelligence, and socio-cultural
          opportunity.</p>

          <p>Dyslexia
          affects individuals throughout their lives; however, its impact can change at
          different stages in a person's life.It is referred to as a learning
          disability because dyslexia can make it very difficult for a student to succeed
          academically in the typical instructional environment and in its more severe
          forms will qualify a student for special education, special accommodations or
          extra support services. </p>

          <p>Texas
          school districts must have a program at all grade levels for students diagnosed
          as having characteristics of dyslexia or related disorders.The Texas
          Education Agency's Dyslexia Handbook: <u>Procedures Concerning Dyslexia and
          Related Disorders</u> contains the State Board of Education (SBOE) approved
          procedures concerning dyslexia and related disorders.</p>

          <h3>Symptoms: Common Signs of Dyslexia</h3>
          <p><strong>Kindergarten - Third Grade</strong></p>
          <ul>
          <li>Failure to
          understand that words are made up of parts and individual sounds</li>
          <li>Difficulty
          learning the letter names and their corresponding sounds</li>
          <li>Difficulty reading single words in isolation</li>
          <li>Uses context for
          word recognition</li>
          <li>Choppy and
          labored reading</li>
          <li>Difficulty spelling
          phonetically</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Fourth Grade - High School</strong></p>
          <ul>
          <li>History of reading and spelling difficulties</li>
          <li>Avoids reading
          aloud</li>
          <li>Reads slowly and
          labored, not fluent</li>
          <li>Avoids reading
          for pleasure</li>
          <li>Difficulty with
          spelling</li>
          </ul>

          <h3><b>How
            are kids with Dyslexia identified?</b></h3>
          <p>The Texas Education Code (State Law) states that students
          enrolling in public schools in this state are to be tested for dyslexia and
          related disorders in accordance with a program approved by the State Board of
          Education.It also states that the Board of Trustees of a school district must
          ensure that there is a procedure for identifying students with dyslexia or
          related disorders and a plan for providing them with the appropriate
          instructional services.</p>

          <p>When a student is not making adequate progress in spite of
          best practices and numerous remedial strategies in the classroom, the student
          may be referred to the campus reading specialist or the person designated to
          perform dyslexia screening.</p>

          <p>A student may be referred for dyslexia screening by
          parents, guardians, counselors, teachers or anyone knowledgeable about the
          student's academic development.</p>

          <h3>Instruction:</h3>
          <p>School districts my purchase a reading program or develop
          their own dyslexia reading program for students with dyslexia and related
          disorders as long as it contains the descriptors found in <u>The Dyslexia
          Handbook</u>, which can be downloaded on the TEA website. </p>

          <h3><strong>TIPS
            for working with students with Dyslexia</strong></h3>
          <p><br>
          Effective
          teachers of dyslexics keep several guiding principles in mind. A student with
          dyslexia </p>
          <ul>
          <li>can be a positive, contributing, and valued class member</li>
          <li>is an intelligent person who does not learn in the same way as
          others</li>
          <li>learns by doing</li>
          <li>often has trouble remembering</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>
          Effective
          teaching strategies and adaptations can help dyslexic students be more
          successful. Consider how you might use the following ideas to help dyslexics
          build the skills they need to overcome the disability. Your initial goal should
          be to reduce the overall reading, writing, and spelling load, while increasing
          the self-confidence of the student. </p>

          an opportunity to make a difference in a struggling student's life. There are
          several options for support, in addition to the adaptations you can make in the
          classroom. Don't hesitate to refer to the special education professional in
          your school for additional references and support.<br>
          <br>
          Dyslexic students deserve your attention to help them be as successful as
          possible. You can be a part of the solution in educating dyslexic students and
          helping them to achieve the educational goals of becoming independent and
          life-long learners.</p>

          <h3 class="box"><b>Differentiated
            Instruction</b><b>
            <img border="0" width="85" height="118" id="Picture 6" src="images/image022.gif"></b></h3>
          <p>Differentiated instruction is a teaching approach in which
          teachers adapt their instruction to student differences. Rather than developing
          a curriculum aimed at the "common student," teachers modify their instruction
          to meeting individual student's readiness levels, preferences, and interests.
          Differentiated instruction recognizes the fact that we have a diverse student
          population and enables educators to teach students of varying abilities in one
          class.</p>

          <p>Carol Tomlinson, professor at the University of Virginia,
          identifies four classroom elements that can be differentiated:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><b>Content</b>:&nbsp; &nbsp;What the student needs to learn. The instructional
          concepts should be broad based, and all students should be given access to the
          same core content. However, the content's complexity should be adapted to
          students' learner profiles. Teachers can vary the presentation of content<i>,(
          i.e</i>., textbooks, lecture, demonstrations, taped texts) to best meet
          students' needs.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Process</b>:&nbsp; &nbsp;Activities in which the student engages to make
            sense of or master the content. Examples of differentiating process activities
            include scaffolding, flexible grouping, interest centers, manipulatives,
            varying the length of time for a student to master content, and encouraging an
            advanced learner to pursue a topic in greater depth.</li>
            <br>
          <li><b>Products</b>: The culminating projects that ask students to apply and extend
          what they have learned. Products should provide students with different ways to
          demonstrate their knowledge as well as various levels of difficulty, group or
          individual work, and various means of scoring.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>Learning Environment</b>: The way the classroom works
          and feels. The differentiated classroom should include areas in which students
          can work quietly as well as collaborate with others, materials that reflect
          diverse cultures, and routines that allow students to get help when the teacher
          isn't available (Tomlinson, 1995, 1999; Winebrenner, 1992, 1996).</li>

          the data gleaned from assessment, teachers learn where students need additional
          instruction as well as determine direction for future instruction.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><b>Implement flexible grouping.</b>&nbsp;Teachers use whole-class,
          small-group, and individual instruction. Students can, and should, be grouped
          in a variety of ways based on readiness, interest, learning profiles, and
          randomly. Teachers can assign work groups, and sometimes students select their
          own work groups.&nbsp; The groups should change often.</p>

          <p><b>Use a range of instructional strategies</b>. In addition to
          planning instructional activities to meet student's learning readiness, all
          activities should be equally interesting and equally focused on essential
          understandings and skills. To make learning student-centered, the teacher
          should employ a wide variety of instructional strategies such as tiered
          activities, hands-on activities, text, scaffolding, and projects. Often
          students are provided with options in the instructional activities they engage
          in as well as in the final assessment tool.</p>

          <p>During
          the Special Education component, you will work with a grid that outlines 9
          different types of modification and accommodations.These are also
          techniques that can be used in the classroom to differentiate the curriculum so
          that all students can have success!</p>
