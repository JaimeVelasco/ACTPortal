        <h2>
            ELPS – English Language Proficiency Standards
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 2007, the State Board of Education approved revised TEKS (<strong>Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills</strong>) for addressing the second language acquisition needs of ELLs (<strong>English Language Learners</strong>). The revised TEKS are called English Language Proficiency Standards (ELPS). These standards provide a common framework for integrating language and content instruction for English learners. The ELP standards require all teachers to provide instruction to ELLs in <strong>listening</strong>, <strong>speaking</strong>, <strong>reading</strong> and <strong>writing</strong>. ELPS is part of required curriculum of each subject.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>ELLs FYI:</strong>
        </p>
          <ul>
              <li>There are over 600,000 in grades K-12</li>
              <li>Over 120 languages are represented in Texas schools</li>
              <li>Majority are Spanish speakers</li>
              <li>Prominent languages other than Spanish</li>
              <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                  <ul>
                      <li>Vietnamese</li>
                      <li>Urdu</li>
                      <li>Arabic</li>
                      <li>Korean</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
          </ul>
        <p>
            To be successful, ELLs must acquire both social and academic language proficiency in English. As classroom teachers we must integrate second language acquisition with <strong>all</strong> content area instruction. ELLs need to know social (BICS) and academic language (CALP) that you learned about in Activity 7.
        </p>
        <p>
            Classroom instruction that effectively integrates second language acquisition with quality content area instruction ensures that ELLs acquire social and academic language proficiency in English, learn the knowledge and skills in the TEKS and reach their full academic potential. These practices also benefit those student populations that we talked about in Activity 2 that suffer from comprehension lags.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        §74.4. English Language Proficiency Standards.

                    <p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>(a) Introduction.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            (1) The English language proficiency standards in this section outline English language proficiency level descriptors and student expectations for English language learners (ELLs). School districts shall implement this section as an integral part of each subject in the required curriculum. The English language proficiency standards are to be published along with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) for each subject in the required curriculum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (2) In order for ELLs to be successful, they must acquire both social and academic language proficiency in English. Social language proficiency in English consists of the English needed for daily social interactions. Academic language proficiency consists of the English needed to think critically, understand and learn new concepts, process complex academic material, and interact and communicate in English academic settings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (3) Classroom instruction that effectively integrates second language acquisition with quality content area instruction ensures that ELLs acquire social and academic language proficiency in English, learn the knowledge and skills in the TEKS, and reach their full academic potential.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (4) Effective instruction in second language acquisition involves giving ELLs opportunities to listen, speak, read, and write at their current levels of English development while gradually increasing the linguistic complexity of the English they read and hear, and are expected to speak and write.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (5) The cross-curricular second language acquisition skills in subsection (c) of this section apply to ELLs in Kindergarten-Grade 12.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (6) The English language proficiency levels of beginning, intermediate, advanced, and advanced high are not grade-specific. ELLs may exhibit different proficiency levels within the language domains of listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The proficiency level descriptors outlined in subsection (d) of this section show the progression of second language acquisition from one proficiency level to the next and serve as a road map to help content area teachers instruct ELLs commensurate with students' linguistic needs.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            (3) provide content-based instruction including the cross-curricular second language acquisition essential knowledge and skills in subsection (c) of this section in a manner that is linguistically accommodated to help the student acquire English language proficiency; and

                        <p>
                            (4) provide intensive and ongoing foundational second language acquisition instruction to ELLs in Grade 3 or higher who are at the beginning or intermediate level of English language proficiency in listening, speaking, reading, and/or writing as determined by the state's English language proficiency assessment system. These ELLs require focused, targeted, and systematic second language acquisition instruction to provide them with the foundation of English language vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and English mechanics necessary to support content-based instruction and accelerated learning of English.

The ELL reads a variety of texts for a variety of purposes with an increasing level of comprehension in all content areas. ELLs may be at the beginning, intermediate, advanced, or advanced high stage of English language acquisition in reading.

For Kindergarten and Grade 1, certain of these student expectations apply to text read aloud for students not yet at the stage of decoding written text. <strong>The student is expected to:</strong>
