          The State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR) is a new state assessment for students in grades 3-12. STAAR replaced the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) in the spring of 2012. The STAAR program includes annual assessments for grades 3-8 in reading and mathematics; assessments in writing at grades 4 and 7; in science at grades 5 and 8; and in social studies at grade 8; and end-of-course assessments for high school students.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will be referencing and practicing with the STAAR in this module. Although testing programs change, the process of <u>test analysis</u>, <u>benchmark information</u> and <u>intervention strategies</u> presented in this module are state mandated training requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The STAAR testing program has serious implications for you as a teacher especially at the high school level. It is important that you have a general understanding of the STAAR testing program. Read through "STAAR FAQ" provided on the TEA website to help provide clarity to this complex process!

          <span class="redbold">Background Information on STAAR</span><br>
          The <span class="origunder">State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness (STAAR)</span> is the standardized testing program used in Texas primary and secondary schools to assess students' attainment of reading, writing, math, science, and social studies skills required under Texas education standards. Legislation requires states to measure student progress in reading and math annually in grades 3 - 8 and at least once in grades 10 - 12. In Texas, students must meet the standard on STAAR to graduate from high school. Results from the STAAR tests are also used to determine the ratings for districts and campuses in the state of Texas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The STAAR test is aligned to the <span class="origunder">Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)</span>, state-mandated curriculum to determine the objectives to assess on each grade level.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tested subjects vary depending by grade level; however, reading and math are always part of the exam. Every portion of the exam includes multiple choice questions. The high school reading and English language arts (combined reading and writing) tests also require students to answer open-ended short answer questions on a narrative and expository selection. The writing and ELA tests include a written composition as well. Unlike the TAKS, <span class="origunder">the STAAR is timed.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          TEA provides STAAR Information Booklets containing details, student expectations, rubrics, and sample test items. Some released tests are also available online.
        </p>
        <p>
          High school students will take STAAR End-of-Course (EOC) tests throughout their years in high school. The required end-of-course assessments include English I, English II, Algebra I, Biology and U.S. History.
        </p>
        <p>
          The STAAR EOC tests focus solely on the curriculm covered in that course. In contrast, the TAKS measured overall knowlege of the general subject, along with some specific questions from course curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/test.gif" width="213" height="174" align="right">Texas high school seniors cannot graduate unless they pass exit-level STAAR tests in English language arts, social studies, math, and science. During their junior and senior years of high school, students are given <span class="origunder">five</span> chances to pass the test.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are alternate Assessments for students receiving special education services. Those students being home-schooled or attending private schools are not required to take the STAAR test.

          As a teacher, you may obtain test information from previous years on all of your students. You will be required to do so in some schools.<br>

          <b>Objective Analysis</b><br>
          Look at the answer sheet in your packet to score your test. Then, fill in the STAAR Analysis with the number of items correct by objective or Reporting Category. It's a little like your score report for your TEXES teacher exams. You are sent your results which are broken down into "domains", instead of objectives.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Which objectives were you weak in?<br></b><br>
          <b>Which were your strongest?<br></b><br>
          Using the <span class="handount">STAAR answer key- Grade 8</span> page in your packet, and your STAAR answer sheet...
        </p>
        <p>
          Refer to Grade 8 Reading Assessment to see a description of the Reporting Categories and Content Student Expectations where you missed questions.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Look at an objective that was identified as your weakness.
          </li>
          <li>Look at the specific skills that are categorized in this objective. Now you know where to focus future study.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          You can also identify specific skills that need re-teaching or reinforcement.

          What strategies did you use to select your answers?
        </p>
        <p>
          Through test results analysis and question analysis students can determine their own level of mastery for each objective, therefore determining their own strengths and weaknesses.

        <p>
          Use of Test Taking strategies provides students with a methodical process to help narrow down choices to select the best answer.

        <p>
          Take a look at <a href="http://www.testtakingtips.com">www.TestTakingTips.com</a> for many strategies that can help your students. These strategies will also help you with your TExES exam.

        <p>
          <span class="redbold"><img src="images/bench.gif" width="144" height="137" align="left">Benchmarks and Interventions</span><br>
          Standards-based assessments are sometimes called <b>benchmarks</b> because they are used to gather data on how students are progressing in their mastery of the curriculum. In Texas, the standards are the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS). The TEKS are aligned through the grades so students in Texas schools are mastering a curriculum that builds as they progress through the grades. The TEKS are also aligned with national standards and College Board expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Benchmarks are "district" assessments, which means that every student in that course or grade level in the district takes the same test at the same time. Data from standards-based benchmarks can be disaggregated according to specific standards rather than just reported as an overall grade like many classroom assessments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Benchmark tests are used to measure the achievement of important standards at intervals throughout the school year. These benchmarks inform teachers of the progress that each of their students is making toward the achievement of crucial standards likely to be assessed on annual standards-based tests such as STAAR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research shows a strong predictive relationship between students' performance on benchmark tests and their performance on state assessments.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/administrator.gif" width="148" height="181" align="right">Not only are Benchmark and STAAR scores referred to by teachers, they are also looked at by campuses and at the district level. School wide scores are reported to principals, and teachers are to develop intervention and remediation plans for students. Teachers are also expected to re-teach skills according to student performance on these tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teachers are to look for student gains from year to year. In most districts, this information is available online, and it is the teacher's responsibility to keep track of his/her student data and be sure that students are recommended for appropriate interventions outside the classroom if needed (tutoring, special programs, etc.). There are also district interventions, such as special reading or math classes that are required for students not passing the STAAR test.
        </p>
        <p>
          DOCUMENT, DOCUMENT, DOCUMENT. . . . Your administrators will base our job performance by how well the kids do on benchmarks and STAAR! Documentation of student progress is a must!
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="images/computer.gif" width="163" height="130" align="right">Helping students progress on STAAR can help you keep your job. You should chart student progress on benchmarks and STAAR tests. This information should be readily available to administrators and Field Supervisors.
