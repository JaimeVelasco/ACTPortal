        The field of special education is so broad and ever changing -- it is impossible to know all there is to know about the field. One way to help you be prepared to better serve your students is for you do be knowledgeable about the handicapping conditions that qualify them for special education services.
      </p>
      <p>
          The assignment is to complete an e/learning notebook. In a three ring binder, create a section for each disability. You should be able to answer the following questions for each disability. You may use the information provided and the internet. For each disability, you are to include one internet reference where you found helpful information about that disability. Print out the first page of the reference, but make sure that the web address is referenced somewhere on the page (you may need to go back to that website someday!) When you have completed this assignment, you will have a reference book that includes all the handicapping conditions with information and references. Feel free to add additional internet references. This will be a valuable tool as you get to your students and how to better serve them in your classes.

          Characteristics
      </p>
      <p>
          Autism results in limitation in several areas which vary with the individual. Characteristics often include impairments in communication, deficits in adaptive behavior, impairments in affective behavior, impairments in affective development, and engagement in stereotypic behaviors. The following are characteristics associated with autism although not every individual with autism will exhibit all listed characteristics:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>Absent or distorted relationships with people inability to relate to people except as to objects, inability to express affection, or ability to build and maintain only distant, suspicious, or bizarre relationships.<br>
              <br>
          </li>
          <li>Extreme or peculiar problems in communication absence of verbal language or language that is not functional, such as echolalia (parroting what one hears), misuse of pronouns (e.g., he for you or I for her), neologisms (made up, meaningless words or sentences), talk that bears little or no resemblance to reality.<br>
              <br>
          </li>
          <li>Self stimulation repetitive, stereotyped behavior that seems to have no purpose other than providing sensory stimulation (this may take a wide variety of forms, such as swishing saliva, twirling objects, patting one's cheeks, flapping one's hands, staring, etc.)<br>
              <br>
          </li>
          <li>Self injury repeated physical self abuse, such as biting, scratching, or poking oneself, head banging, etc.<br>
              <br>
          </li>
          <li>Perceptual anomalies unusual responses or absence of response to stimuli that seems to indicate sensory impairment or unusual sensitivity. (Hallahan &amp; Kauffman, 1994, p. 227)
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="parahead">
          Etiology
      </p>
      <p>
          There appears to be no one specific cause for autism. Possible causes include neurological damage, either prenatally or in infancy, and chromosomal irregularities.
      </p>
      <p class="parahead">
          Effects on Normal Development
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <i>Oral Language</i> - Language development may be delayed or impaired. A significant number of children with autism do not develop speech. Some individuals exhibit unusual speech patterns such as echolalia.<br>
              <br>
          </li>
          <li>
              <i>Cognitive</i> - Many children within this category exhibit lowered intellectual functioning. Their activities appear to develop unevenly with more advanced skills sometimes being evidenced before lower skills are acquired. Difficulty with abstract ideas, resistance to change, and attending to one stimulus for extended periods of time are behaviors seen in this group.<br>
              <br>
          </li>
          <li>
              <i>Social</i> - Social skills may be significantly delayed. Some children with autism are unresponsive to many aspects of their environment and, therefore, do not acquire interpersonal skills in an efficient manner.<br>
              <br>
          </li>
          <li>
              <i>Motor</i> - Stereotypical or repetitive behaviors are characteristic of children with autism. Fine and gross motor delays also are evidenced.<br>
              <br>
          </li>
          <li>
              <i>Affective Development</i> - Infants with autism may be unresponsive to other individuals. In childhood, affective development may be severely delayed, or the child may experience difficulties in relating to others, and/or display inappropriate emotions.

Hearing impairment includes two categories. Deaf individuals are those who are unable to process linguistic information (usually speech) through hearing, with or without amplification. Individuals considered to be hard of hearing have enough residual hearing to be able to process language through the ear.

    Characteristics
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Due to the seriousness of sensory impairment, children in Texas with auditory or visual handicaps are eligible for services at birth. The more severe the impairment, the more services are required. The age of onset, type of hearing loss, and severity of the loss are major determiners in the ultimate functioning of the individual with a hearing impairment.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Age of onset</i> - Prelingual hearing impairment, hearing loss prior to the age of 2, generally has far more serious implications on overall functioning than postlingual losses, or hearing loss after the acquisition of speech and language.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Types of hearing impairment</i> - Conductive losses are disorders of the outer or middle ear, and result in the reduction or loss of loudness. Sensorineural losses are associated with damage to the inner ear or auditory nerve and may result in more serious and permanent losses than conductive losses. Mixed losses are a combination of both.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Severity of loss</i> - Hearing impairment may be considered mild (hard of hearing), moderate (hard of hearing), severe (hard of hearing/deaf), or profound (deaf.). Loss is determined through audiometric assessment and is measured in decibels (dB), loudness, and Hertz units (Hz), frequency.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="parahead">
    Etiology
</p>
<p>
    Causes of hearing impairments are either congenital or acquired.
</p>
<p>
    Congenital (present at birth) causes include: hereditary conditions; prenatal diseases such as otosclerosis; maternal diseases such as rubella (German measles); and conditions occurring during gestation.
</p>
<p>
    Acquired causes of hearing impairment include postnatal infections and physical trauma.

        <i>Oral Language</i> - Speech and language skills are often seriously affected by hearing impairment. Language development may be delayed. Some deaf individuals are unable to use intelligible speech, others may speak but be difficult to understand. Mild or moderate hearing losses, however, may affect oral language only minimally.<br>
        <br>

        <i>Concepts</i>, however, are acquired more slowly than by hearing individuals. Academic achievement, particularly in the area of reading, will be significantly delayed in comparison to hearing students.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Social</i> - Since social skills are acquired primarily through visual and auditory experiences, hearing impaired individuals often are socially immature. Some deaf individuals remain socially isolated.<br>

    Characteristics
</p>
<p>
    Several different systems are used to classify individuals with emotional disturbance. Levels of severity such as mild, moderate, and severe are sometimes associated with psychiatric designations such as manic depression and schizophrenia. Dimensional classifications are more often used with school age children.
</p>
<p>
    Achenback, Howell, Quay, and Conners (1991) have suggested two broad dimensions of disordered behavior: externalizing and internalizing. External behaviors involve striking out against others.
</p>
<p>
    Internalizing behaviors involve mental and emotional conflicts, such as depression and anxiety. Individuals may demonstrate behavioral characteristics of more than one dimension, since dimensions are not mutually exclusive. Quay and Peterson (1987) describe six dimensions with associated behaviors.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Conduct disorder</i> seeks attention, shows off, is disruptive, annoys others, fights, has temper tantrums.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Socialized aggression</i> steals in company with others, is loyal to delinquent friends, is truant from school with others, has "bad" companions, freely admits disrespect for moral values and laws.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Attention problems, immaturity</i> has short attention span, has poor concentration, is distractible, is easily diverted from task at hand, answers without thinking, is sluggish, is slow moving, is lethargic.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Anxiety withdrawal</i> is self conscious, is easily embarrassed, is hypersensitive, feelings are easily hurt, is generally fearful, is depressed, is always sad.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Psychotic Behavior</i> expresses far fetched ideas, has repetitive speech, shows bizarre behavior.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Motor excess</i> is restless, is unable to sit still, is tense, is unable to relax, is over talkative.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="parahead">
    Etiology
</p>
<p>
    Etiology of a given case of emotional disturbance is difficult to determine. Possible causes include: inappropriate learning, inherited disorders, chromosomal irregularities, brain abnormalities, and behavior changes due to biochemical substances.
</p>
<p class="parahead">
    Effects on Normal Development
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Oral Language</i> - Oral language may approximate normal, be inappropriate for the circumstances or social situation, have strange qualities to it such as echolalia, or be totally nonexistent.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Cognitive</i> - Average or below average intelligence usually is associated with children with emotional disorders. Children with severe disorders tend to have IQ scores that fall within the mentally retarded range. Adaptive behavior also will be affected for individuals with severe disturbances. "True" intelligence, therefore, may be hidden due to the 'effects of the emotional and behavior problems. Most students with this disorder are underachievers at school.. Many may have severe deficits in learning basic reading and math. Finally, some students may not possess basic self care or living skills (e.g., using the toilet, grooming, <i>dressing</i>, etc.).<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Social - This is an area of difficulty for individuals with emotional disturbance. Interpersonal relations may be nonexistent, inappropriate, or unsatisfactory. Most students with emotional or behavioral disorders are not well liked by their peers. The most common problems include hitting, fighting, teasing, yelling, refusing to comply with request, crying, destructiveness, and vandalism.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Motor</i> - For most individuals with behavior disorders, motor development approximates normal. For the seriously disturbed, differences in posture and ambulation may be noted. Repetitive and even self mutilating behaviors may be evidenced.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Affective Development</i> - Affective or emotional development will be abnormal. The degree will depend on the severity of the disturbance. Behavior may be normal but inappropriate for the setting or circumstances, or it may be so abnormal that it is bizarre in any setting.

    <span class="parahead">Adaptive Behavior</span>
</p>
<p>
    Adaptive behavior is defined as how well the individual meets the demands of age appropriate tasks. Adaptive behavior includes language, cognitive, social, motor, affective, and vocational development. Before the child enters school, adaptive behavior focuses on the developmental tasks associated with language, social, motor, and self help skills. Upon entry into school, adaptive behavior tasks include academic achievement. Students with mental retardation fall well behind their non-retarded peers in this area. As the child with mental retardation progresses through school, social development assumes an important role. As a group, persons with mental retardation have difficulty making friends, tend to have poor self concepts, and engage in higher rates of inattention and disruptive behavior than their non-retarded classmates. Vocational and career aspects become major issues in adaptive behavior as the person with mental retardation approaches the traditional ages for school completion.
</p>
<p class="parahead">
    Etiology
</p>
<p>
    Biological/organic causes include infections and intoxications, trauma or physical injury, metabolic or nutritional deficiencies, chromosomal anomalies, abnormalities of gestation, environmental influences, and other factors. Psychosocial causes are thought to be responsible for most cases of mild retardation and include early environmental and social inadequacies.

The types of motor impairment include: spasticity (the most common), athetosis, ataxia, rigidity, tremor, atonia and mixed. CP also is characterized by the body parts or limbs affected: monoplegia (one limb) paraplegia (legs involved) hemiplegia (one side of the body) double hemiplegia (both sides of the body affected to different degrees) triplegia (three limbs involved) quadriplegia (all four limbs involved) diplegia (legs involved more than the arms. The effects may be minimal, or quite severe. Speech language, vision, hearing, and intellectual deficits may accompany the CP.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Spina Bifida</i> is a birth defect in which the casing around the spinal cord fails to close. The effects may be minimal or severe. In its severe form, spina bifida mylelomeningocele, there often is paralysis of the lower body and lack of bowel movements and bladder control.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Spinal cord injuries</i> may result from accidents or disease. The effects depend upon the site and extent of the injury. Long term rehabilitation and therapy mya me needed.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Convulsive disorders</i> may occur with other neurological conditions or be independent. When seizures are recurring, the condition is usually referred to as epilepsy.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Tonic/clonic seizures</i> formerly known as grand mal seizures, are characterized by a loss of consciousness and contractions of the muscles. The individual may lose bladder and bowel control and often will be very drowsy when the seizure ends. Absence seizures, formerly known as petit mal seizures, are characterized by periods of inattention or daydreaming which may be accompanied by slight repetitive muscle movements. A variety of seizure control medication may be prescribed.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Musculoskeletal disorders</i> - Disorders of the musculoskeletal system refer to those conditions affecting muscles and bones. Muscular dystrophy is an inherited condition in which the muscles degenerate and are replaced by fatty tissue. The most common form, Duchenne, is progressive, affects mainly males and is almost always fatal.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="parahead">
    Etiology
</p>
<p>
    Falls, accidents, sports injuries, child abuse, prenatal or postnatal disease or infection, hereditary conditions, and congenital abnormalities are among the causes of orthopedic and health impairments.
</p>
<p class="parahead">
    Effects on Normal Development
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Oral Language</i> - Most individuals with orthopedic impairments will not be deficient in oral language development and production. Exceptions to this would be conditions which might affect neurological functioning or motor and muscle development necessary for the production of speech such as often as it occurs in cerebral palsy.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Cognitive</i> - With any neurological involvement, there is always the possibility of cognitive delay and impairment in mental functioning. In many physical or health impairments, however, cognitive development and functioning are within the normal range.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Social</i> - Social development and the acquisition of social skills may be affected by physical and health handicaps. Absences from school or social functions due to illness and limited participation in certain school and community functions may contribute to social problems. There also may be stigma attached to physical differences that preclude normal interactions with the general public.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Motor</i> - This is the area most affected by physical and health impairments. The effect, however, varies with the condition and its severity. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and adapted physical education may help to improve or maintain motor ability. Special equipment and adaptive devices may be necessary to allow the individual as much mobility and independent functioning as possible.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Affective Development</i> - Affective development should approximate that of the non-handicapped population except where cognitive impairment also is involved. Some health conditions appear to be accompanied by emotional factors

    <span class="parahead">IDEA:</span> Specific learning disability means a disorder of one or more of the basic psychological processes involved in understanding or in using language, spoken or written, which may manifest itself in an imperfect ability to listen, think, read, write, spell, or do arithmetic calculations. The term includes such conditions as perceptual handicaps, brain injury, minimal brain dysfunction, dyslexia, and developmental aphasia. The term does not include children who have learning problems which are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor disabilities, of mental retardation, or emotional disturbance, environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage.

    (h) Learning disabled student. Specific eligibility criteria for learning disabled students are defined in 89.234 of this title (relating to Learning Disabled Students Criteria for Determining the Existence of a Severe Discrepancy Between Achievement and Intellectual Ability)
</p>
<p class="parahead">
    Characteristics
</p>
<p>
    By definition, a severe discrepancy must exist between achievement and intellectual ability in one or more of the following areas: oral expression, listening comprehension, written expression, basic reading skill, reading comprehension, mathematical calculation, and/or mathematical reasoning. Learning disabilities may range from mild to severe.
</p>
<p>
    An IQ achievement discrepancy means that the student is not achieving up to his potential as measured by standardized tests. There are different methods for determining a discrepancy. One method is to compare the mental age obtained from an intelligence test to a grade age equivalent taken from a standardized achievement test. A difference of two years or more may be enough to indicate a learning disability. A second method for determination of a discrepancy is to use a statistical formula, that is to compare standard scores from the intelligence test to scores obtained from an achievement test. When the standard score discrepancy is greater than one standard deviation, a learning disability is presumed to exist.
</p>
<p>
    A disorder in one or more of the basic psychological processes presumes that the child has deficits in abilities involved with perception and interpretation of incoming stimuli. For example, the child's reading problems could be associated with perception, memory, attention, or association of the printed symbol with the spoken language give to the symbols. Numerous studies have documented the existence of attention related problems with learning disabled populations (Hallahan &amp; Kauffman, 1994). Researchers have found that learning disabled students are inefficient learners and employ poor or no learning strategies to assist them acquire and retain new information. They tend to be poor in comprehension monitoring ability to keep track of one's own comprehension or reading materials and to make adjustments to comprehend better while reading. As a result of poor learning strategies many learning disabled students learn to not believe in his or her own abilities.
</p>
<p class="parahead">
    Etiology
</p>
<p>
    It is seldom possible to determine the cause of a learning disability. Possible causes include maturational delays, neurological damage or abnormality, inherited abnormalities, and environmental factors such as dietary inadequacies, pollution, additives to food and drinking water, stress, and intoxicants. Effects on Normal Development
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Oral language</i> - Language, spoken and/or written, is one of the major deficit areas associated with learning disabilities.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Difficulties with perception and discrimination of visual, auditory, and/or haptic information could affect receptive and expressive language.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Cognitive</i> - Individuals identified as learning disabled have average or near average intelligence. Deficiencies in perceiving, processing, retaining, and expressing information are problem areas for most students with LD. Short attention span, selective attention, and distractibility also are characteristics often associated with learning disabilities.Social - Children with LD encounter difficulties with social relationships. Such difficulties appear to be related to faulty perceptions whereby they incorrectly interpret words, expressions, or gestures and, therefore, respond in an inappropriate manner.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Motor</i> - Hyperactivity is a characteristic attributed to many children with learning disabilities. Gross and fine motor problems, as well as difficulties with eye/hand coordination, also are prevalent in this population.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Affective Development</i> - Affective development sometimes lags behind chronological age which may be due to the deficits in social skills. Students with learning disabilities may encounter a great deal of failure and frustration before their handicap is identified which may create difficulties in the emotional area.

    Characteristics
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Speech</i> - Speech is considered to be abnormal when it deviates so far from the speech of other individuals that it: calls attention to itself; impedes communication, or makes the speaker uncomfortable. The majority of speech problems of school age children are those of articulation (faulty production of sound) and fall into four categories: substitution, distortion, omission, and addition. Other speech problems include disorders of voice (problems in pitch, volume, and quality), and fluency (stuttering or cluttering).<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Language</i> -Language problems result from language delays and language disorders. Language disorders include problems in the reception or expression of language and aphasia. Receptive language disorders refer to problems in understanding language. Expressive language disorders refer to problems in formulating and using language. Aphasia may impair language acquisition and/or expression due to injury, disease, or incomplete brain development.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Etiology</i> - Causes of speech and language disorders include: emotional problems, faulty learning, inadequate experiences and opportunities for developing appropriate language, physiological abnormalities such as cleft palate, neurological damage such as that associated with cerebral palsy, and hearing impairment.
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="parahead">
    Effects on Normal Development
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Oral Language</i> - This is the area most affected by language disorders. The services needed depend upon the type and severity of the problem. Speech/language pathologists or speech clinicians are affiliated with all public schools and work individually or in small groups with children meeting the criteria for this handicapping condition. The most common oral language problem encountered among school age children is articulation disorders.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Cognitive</i> - In general, Speech handicapped children would have the same range of intellectual abilities as the nonspeech impaired. Language disabilities, however, may seriously affect learning and impede academic achievement and social development.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Social</i> - The affect on the social development of a given child depends upon the type of speech or language impairment and the severity. When speech deviates from normal, it generally makes both the speaker and listener uncomfortable. If severe enough, the child may become a social isolate. Difficulty with communication may impact all aspects of an individual's life.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Motor</i> - Unless the speech and/or language problems are associated with other handicapping conditions such as cerebral palsy or mental retardation, motor development should approximate normal.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Affective Development</i> - Severe speech and language problems may result in emotional and social delays and disturbances.

    (A) A student with a visual impairment is one who has been determined to meet the criteria for visual impairment as stated in 34 CFR, ��300.8(c)(13). The visual loss should be stated in exact measures of visual field and corrected visual acuity at a distance and at close range in each eye in a report by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist. The report should also include prognosis whenever possible. If exact measures cannot be obtained, the eye specialist must so state and provide best estimates. In meeting the criteria stated in 34 CFR, ��300.8(c)(13), a student with a visual impairment is one who:

    <p>
        (ii) has been determined by the following evaluations to have a need for special services:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            (I) a functional vision evaluation by a professional certified in the education of students with visual impairments or a certified orientation and mobility instructor.

        </p>
        <p>
            (II) a learning media assessment by a professional certified in the education of students with visual impairments. The learning media assessment must include recommendations concerning which specific visual, tactual, and/or auditory learning media are appropriate for the student and whether or not there is a need for ongoing evaluation in this area.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
    (B) A student with a visual impairment is functionally blind if, based on the preceding evaluations, the student will use tactual media (which includes Braille) as a primary tool for learning to be able to communicate in both reading and writing at the same level of proficiency as other students of comparable ability.
</p>
<p class="parahead">
    Characteristics
</p>
<p>
    Characteristics of individuals with visual impairments would vary with the degree of impairment as well as the age of onset. Total loss of sight prior to the age of 5 usually has a negative affect on overall functioning. Due to the seriousness of sensory impairment, children in Texas with visual or auditory handicaps are eligible for services at birth. The more severe the impairment, the more services are required.
</p>
<p>
    Orientation (position in space relative to other people and objects in the environment) and mobility (moving around in the environment) training must begin early, along with listening skills and the use of optical aids (if appropriate).

    Effects on Normal Development
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <i>Oral language</i> - Concept development necessary to the acquisition of receptive and expressive vocabulary may be delayed and somewhat limited due to the inability to visually associate objects with their names.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Cognitive</i> - If no other handicaps exist, overall intelligence would be similar to that of a nonvisually impaired individual, although various aspects of intelligence may be affected. General fund of knowledge may be limited due to inability to visually explore one's surroundings. The development of spatial relations may be hampered by the loss of sight.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Social</i> - Since many social skills are acquired through visually observing others in social settings, visually impaired individuals may encounter social difficulties because of this lack of experience as well as their limited or inappropriate use of nonverbal communication or body language. Some blind individuals develop "blindisms" or stereotypic movements that draw attention to themselves in social situations.<br>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <i>Motor</i> - Difficulties with spatial concepts and orientation skills may affect perceptual motor abilities.<br>
