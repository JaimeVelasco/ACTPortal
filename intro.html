                        </p>
                        <p>
                          During this component you will participate in several activities to learn about current research based instructional practices to work with all students to become better readers. Some of the activities are specific to elementary readers, and others may be specific to secondary readers.<br>
                          <br>
                          Remember, just because a student is in 9th grade, it doesn't mean that they read like a 9th grader. The same may hold true for advanced students at the elementary level.<br>
                          <br>
                          Throughout this component, you will be able to pace yourself through the online reading elements and then watch a video that reinforces and enhances the reading assignment. There may also be opportunities to do further reading on additional websites.<br>
                          <br>
                          We encourage you to absorb all you can about the reading process. Reading is the fundamental building block for success in all academic subject areas!<br>
                          <br>
                          <b>Take a few minutes to learn about one of our instructors, Leslie Wild.</b>
                        </p>
                   
                        <p>
                          <img src="../images/computer.gif" width="163" height="130" align="right">You will need to refer to the packet of handouts that accompany this reading module. There will be several times throughout the session that you will be required to reflect and answer questions about topics that have been presented. Each section has an <b>Activity Summary</b> page for you to take notes and reflect on that activity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          There will be several different occasions where we will ask you to look at specific information on the internet. We do our best to be sure that all links are up to date. However, technology changes fast, and if you find links that are no longer current, please send an email to the reading instructor. The concepts we are referring you to, are "Big Ideas" or major concepts that can easily be found in a "Google" search.<br>
                          <br>
                          You will be introduced to several excellent references during this module. Keep a list of websites to print out later and add to your teacher website.<br>
                          <br>
                          At the end of the Reading Module, you will take a ten question quiz, which you will have two chances to master.<br>
                          <br>
                          Begin by viewing Comprehensible Input Techniques. This will be your assignment we will expect to see once you are in the classroom.<br>
                          <br>
                          After you have an idea of what your tangible will be, you can begin the course by clicking on item 1 from the Table of Contents. You may stop and start as you work through the module by making a selection from the Table of Contents.
