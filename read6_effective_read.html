          <span class="redbold">1. <span>Phonemic Awareness</span></span><span> 
        -</span> <b>hear</b>, identify and manipulate sounds; the understanding that the 
        sounds of spoken language work together to make words. 
        </p><p><b>Phonemic awareness</b> 
        is a subcategory of phonological awareness. Phonological awareness includes identifying 
        and manipulating larger parts of spoken language, such as words, syllables, and 
        also other aspects of sound, such as rhyming. </p><p>Locate the <span class="handount">Progression 
        of Phonological Awareness handout</span> <b>and watch the following video. </b>

        </p>

        <p> 
        <br><span class="redbold">2. Phonics</span> - understanding that there is a predictable 
        <b>relationship</b> between phonemes (sounds) and graphemes (letters) </p><p>Find 
        the <span class="handount">Phonics handout</span> and take a few minutes to complete.. 
        </p><p>Watch the following video clip. 

        </p>

        <p class="redbold">Phonics 
        Instruction </p><p>Locate the <span class="handount">Progression of Phonics Instruction 
        handout. </span></p><p>Review The progression of skills from Kinder to 3rd grade. 
        </p><p><b>Phonics /Alphabet Recognition/Alphabetic Principal </b><br>In order for 
        reading to occur, students must have <span class="origunder">alphabet recognition.</span> 
        <br>Regardless of the label, the goal of <span class="origunder">phonics</span> 
        instruction is to help children learn and use the <b class="origunder">alphabetic 
        principle</b>--the understanding that there are systematic and predictable relationships 
        between written letters and spoken sounds. Knowing these relationships will help 
        children recognize familiar words accurately and automatically, and "decode" new 
        words. In short, knowledge of the alphabetic principle contributes greatly to 
        children's ability to read words both in isolation and in connected text. </p><p> 
        <br>Students must understand that letters have distinct sounds. For <span class="origunder">alphabetic 
        principle</span>, students must be able to visually recognize and name the letters 
        of the alphabet in both lower and uppercase. What are the very best activities 
        we can do in order to support the development of the alphabetic principle? </p><p> 
        <br>If students cannot recognize and discriminate one letter shape from another, 
        teaching phonics will make little sense. Letters and groups of letters represent 
        phonemes that equal the alphabetic principle; example: <br>"book" has 3 phonemes---b/oo/k 
        </p><p> <br><span class="redbold">3. Fluency </span>- the ability to <b>read a text</b> 
        accurately and quickly (Remember in activity #2 you read an expository text on 
        fluency?) </p><p class="parahead">High Frequency Words / Sight Words </p><p> "Only 100 
        words account for 50% of all words in English print." (Fry 1993) <br>Sight words 
        are an important part of reading instruction and word study. Strong knowledge 
        of sight words improves readers' fluency and aids comprehension. One way to help 
        your students identify words is to practice. This technique is especially helpful 
        with emergent readers who have trouble reading because they can't identify enough 
        words to read a book. This list of 300 high-frequency words can be used to develop 
        activities aimed at boosting students' sight word recognition. </p><p>Write down 10 
        words that might be in the first 100 words. 
        </p><p>Find a copy of the Fry Word List (first 100):<br>

        </p><p>Check to see if any of your guesses appear in the first 100. </p><p>Many of the 
        words in print <span class="origunder">do</span> <span class="origunder">conform</span> 
        to the phonics rules you will teach, <b>"regular words".</b> However, <span class="origunder">many 
        of the words that appear most often in English are considered "irregular"</span>. 
        As such, they cannot be taught using phonics, <span class="redbold">they must 
        be taught VISUALLY, NOT AUDITORILY THROUGH PHONICS. </span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> <br>Besides 
        the Sight word list, you will need the<span class="handount"> newspaper article</span> 
        from you packet to complete the following activity.

        morphemes, the smallest unit of meaning in a word. These units of meaning could 
        be roots, prefixes and suffixes. Students who understand words and their morphological 
        structure are better able to get the meaning of words and are better prepared 
        for increased reading and writing demands across the curriculum in different content 
        areas. </p><p>Students with knowledge of morphology are better able to separate out 
        the morphemes into meaningful units which can be used in decoding and comprehending 
        unfamiliar words. </p><p>For more information on Adolescent Literacy take a look at:
