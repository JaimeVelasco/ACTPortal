          The 10 Basic Steps in Special Education 
        </h3>
        <p>
          <img src="img/stepicon.png" id="imagen" class="right">Children can have all sorts of difficulties growing up. Sometimes problems are obvious right from the start; and sometimes they don't appear until a child is in school.Some children have trouble learning to read or write. Others have a hard time remembering new information. Still others may have trouble with their behavior. For some children, growing up can be very hard to do!
        </p>
        <p>
          When a child is having trouble in school, it's important to find out why. The child may have a disability. By law, schools must provide special help to eligible children with disabilities. This help is called <span>special education</span> and <span>related services</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Although you will learn much more about this process during the face to face components of Institute, this brief overview is an excellent place to start. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, we've distilled the process into 10 basic steps. Once you have the big picture of the process, it's easier to understand the many details under each step.

                  Child is identified as possibly needing special education and related services.
                </h4>
               <p>
                There are two primary ways in which children are identified as possibly needing special education and related services: the system known as Child Find (which operates in each state), and by referral of a parent or school personnel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Child Find. Each state is required by IDEA to identify, locate, and evaluate all children with disabilities in the state who need special education and related services. To do so, states conduct what are known as Child Find activities. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  When a child is identified by Child Find as possibly having a disability and as needing special education, parents may be asked for permission to evaluate their child. Parents can also call the Child Find office and ask that their child be evaluated. 
                </p>
                <p>Referral or request for evaluation. A school professional may ask that a child be evaluated to see if he or she has a disability. Parents may also contact the child's teacher or other school professional to ask that their child be evaluated. This request may be verbal, but it's best to put it in writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Parental consent is needed before a child may be evaluated. Under the federal IDEA regulations, evaluation needs to be completed within 60 days after the parent gives consent. However, if a State's IDEA regulations give a different timeline for completion of the evaluation, the State's timeline is applied.

                </h4>
                <p>
                  Evaluation is an essential early step in the special education process for a child. It's intended to answer these questions: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Does the child have a disability that requires the provision of special education and related services?</li>
                  <li> What are the child's specific educational needs?</li>
                  <li> What special education services and related services, then, are appropriate for addressing those needs?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  By law, the initial evaluation of the child must be "full and individual"-which is to say, focused on that child and that child alone. The evaluation must assess the child in all areas related to the child's suspected disability. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  The evaluation results will be used to decide the child's eligibility for special education and related services and to make decisions about an appropriate educational program for the child. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the parents disagree with the evaluation, they have the right to take their child for an Independent Educational Evaluation (IEE). They can ask that the school system pay for this IEE.

                  A group of qualified professionals and the parents look at the child's evaluation results. Together, they decide if the child is a "child with a disability," as defined by IDEA.

                  If the child is found to be a child with a disability, as defined by IDEA, he or she is eligible for special education and related services. Within 30 calendar days after a child is determined eligible, the IEP team must meet to write an IEP for the child.

                <p>
                  Many times IEP meetings are also called ARD Meetings -The letters ARD stand for Admission, Review, &amp; Dismissal committee. This is the name of the committee responsible for making the educational decisions for a student. At the ARD meeting, an IEP (Individual Education Plan) is developed that outlines specific goals and objectives for each student to master.

                <p>
                  The school system schedules and conducts the IEP meeting. School staff must:

                  <li> contact the participants, including the parents; </li>

                <p>
                  The IEP team gathers to talk about the child's needs and write the student's IEP. Parents and the student (when appropriate) are full participating members of the team. If the child's placement is decided by a different group, the parents must be part of that group as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Before the school system may provide special education and related services to the child for the first time, the parents must give consent. The child begins to receive services as soon as possible after the IEP is written and this consent is given. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the parents do not agree with the IEP and placement, they may discuss their concerns with other members of the IEP team and try to work out an agreement. If they still disagree, parents can ask for mediation, or the school may offer mediation. Parents may file a complaint with the state education agency and may request a due process hearing, at which time mediation must be available.

                  The school makes sure that the child's IEP is carried out as it was written. Parents are given a copy of the IEP. Each of the child's teachers and service providers has access to the IEP and knows his or her specific responsibilities for carrying out the IEP. This includes the accommodations, modifications, and support services that must be provided to the child, in keeping with the IEP.

                <p>
                  The child's progress toward the annual goals is measured, as stated in the IEP. His or her parents are regularly informed of their child's progress and whether that progress is enough for the child to achieve the goals by the end of the year. These progress reports must be given to parents at least as often as parents are informed of their non-disabled children's progress.

                <p>
                  The child's IEP is reviewed by the IEP team at least once a year, or more often if the parents or school ask for a review. If necessary, the IEP is revised. Parents, as team members, must be invited to participate in these meetings. Parents can make suggestions for changes, can agree or disagree with the IEP, and agree or disagree with the placement.
                </p>

                  If parents do not agree with the IEP and placement, they may discuss their concerns with other members of the IEP team and try to work out an agreement. There are several options, including additional testing, an independent evaluation, or asking for mediation, or a due process hearing. They may also file a complaint with the state education agency.

                  At least every three years the child must be reevaluated. This evaluation is often called a "triennial." Its purpose is to find out if the child continues to be a child with a disability, as defined by IDEA, and what the child's educational needs are. However, the child must be reevaluated more often if conditions warrant or if the child's parent or teacher asks for a new evaluation.

            ECI is state and federally funded through the <span class="origunder">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, P.L. 108-446)</span>. This funding ensures that local education agencies participate in <span class="origunder">Child Find</span> to seek out children that may need or qualify for these services. 
          </p>

           <h3>What is Child Find?</h3>
           <p>
            With the assistance of the Texas Education Agency (TEA) and the education service centers (ESC), local education agencies (LEAs) must ensure that a free appropriate public education (FAPE) is provided to all individuals with disabilities, ages 3-21, who qualify for special education services. With the assistance of the Texas Education Agency, ESCs, and the Early Childhood Intervention (ECI) program, Leas must ensure that early intervention services are made available for those children, ages 0-3, with an identified need. 
          </p>
          <p>
            To carry out these responsibilities, Leas must implement: <span class="origunder">a comprehensive system of "Child Find" in which the applicant agency personnel actively search for all individuals with disabilities or developmental delays who are 0-21 years of age</span>. The applicant agency is responsible for<span class="origunder"> identifying, locating, and evaluating all individuals 0-21 years of age</span>, regardless of nature or severity of disability. Once a local education agency (LEA) or a program determines eligibility, all individuals 0-21 years of age, regardless of the severity of the disability or developmental delay, are served by either the LEA (3-21 years of age) in accordance with Texas Education Code 25.001 or an ECI program (0-3 years of age) (34 CFR 300.128, 300.220, 300.300 Note 3; 34 CFR 303.16, 303.321; and 19 TAC 89.1035). 
          </p>
          <p>
            Individuals at state, regional, and local levels are in the process of "Rethinking Child Find in Texas." As a part of this process, a statewide networking system is being established to facilitate coordination and collaboration of all child find efforts. Results of this networked system are to be dissemination of child find information, effective communication among individuals, and identification of persons who can serve as resources for local child find efforts. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that you have an understanding of what early childhood services are, along with some of the basic terminology, take a few minutes and <span class="redbold">read the article in your handouts from NICHCY.</span>
          </p>

        During this activity, you will be looking at several elements and stages of development; from early childhood to late adolescence. It is important to understand these stages to have a better understanding and knowledge base as to what is considered to be "normal" levels of functioning. This information will also resurface when you go to take your PPR exam - since that test covers early childhood through 12th grade student development. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You will get to cut and paste for this activity! In your handouts, you will find several pages labeled <b>FACTOIDS</b>. These factoids are in no particular order. It is your job to <b>PUT THEM IN ORDER!</b> You will need to cut out each group of factoids so that you can move them around easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have your factoids cut out, look for your handouts with the following labels:
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Developmental Stages 2-5 year olds - (2 pages)</li>
          <li> Physical, Cognitive and Emotional Development of 6-9 year olds </li>
          <li>Physical, Cognitive and Emotional Development of 10-13 year olds </li>
          <li>Physical, Cognitive and Emotional Development of 13-17 year olds </li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        You will need to match up the factoids with the appropriate ages of development and glue them on the paper.

        So now that we know what the services are, who qualifies, and how the services are delivered, lets take a look at what happens once the kids are on the school campus. 
      </p>
      <a name="ppcd" data-magellan-destination="ppcd"></a> <!-- magellan destination -->
      <h3>What is PPCD?</h3>
      <p>
        PPCD stands for Preschool Programs for Children with Disabilities. It is important to remember that the second "P" represents "Programs" and not "Place." PPCD programs are not limited to a self-contained room on an elementary or early childhood campus in which students with disabilities are cared for all day. Districts should offer a full continuum of services to educate young children with disabilities. This means offering services to preschoolers with disabilities in a variety of settings based on the child's individual needs, and include being educated alongside typical same-aged peers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="redbold">What does "3 is 3" mean?</span> Children who have been identified as in need of special education services, or are suspected of needing special education services prior to age three, must be provided services on or before their third birthday. An Admission, Review, and Dismissal (ARD) committee meeting determines these services.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="redbold">How does a child qualify for PPCD services?</span> Children qualify for PPCD services through the special education referral process. Once a referral is made, a district has 60 calendar days in which to assess a child and 30 calendar days after the assessment has been completed to hold an ARD meeting. The ARD committee determines if the child is eligible for services and what those services should be by constructing an Individual Education Plan (IEP) for the child
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="redbold">Can a child be in PPCD and Title I Pre-kindergarten or Head Start at the same time? </span>Yes. It is important to remember, however, that a child's ARD committee determines placement. If a child is eligible to attend Title I Pre-kindergarten or Head Start, the child may be served in those classes. Children may even be placed in a Pre-kindergarten or Head Start class if they are not eligible, as long as they do not prevent an eligible child from attending. It is important to remember that 10% of Head Start students should be students with disabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="redbold">Can a child be in PPCD and private school at the same time?</span> A child may dual enroll in a district and a private school until the student's fifth birthday. The child's ARD committee must determine the manner in which services would be provided to such a student. Upon the child's fifth birthday, the child no longer has the right to dual enroll and the district is required only to provide indirect services to the child.
