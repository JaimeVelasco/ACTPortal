              Reflect as to when you were a child and where you are now as a reader. Over the years, you have read a variety of book genres and discovered which are your favorites. We tend to like books that are interesting and exciting or books that we can relate to. You have been taught, or learned on your own, how to compare stories and writing styles as well as find similarities and differences in stories or articles. As adults, we also realize the importance of reading in terms of gaining knowledge. Through experience we have developed as readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The challenge for you as a teacher is to help students gain the skills necessary to develop and become lifetime readers. Many students don't like to read, or don't have the skills or experience needed to read material at their grade level. It will be up to you to understand how to introduce or prepare your students for the reading processes necessary for your classroom and beyond.
            </p>
            <p>
              Much of what you do in the classroom will result from your personal understanding of the reading process. The understanding of the mental processes involved as a reader can help you make decisions about instruction in your classes. There are as many options available to you as the diverse needs of your students.
            </p>
            <p>
              The definition of literacy has changed. It's not just being able to sign your name. Education today goes beyond presenting students with information and must ensure that students retain important information. Students must understand topics and actively use the knowledge they gain.
