          <img src="images/lights.gif" width="133" height="91" align="left">Teachers set the stage for learning by finding out what students already know, then connect new ideas to students' existing knowledge base. Using a variety of instructional strategies, teachers guide students from the known to the unknown, from familiar territory to new concepts.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          <img src="images/sherlock.gif" width="100" height="65" align="right"><span class="origunder">Cues, questions, and advance organizers are among the tools and strategies that teachers use to set the stage for learning.</span> These tools create a framework that helps students focus on what they are about to learn.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          Asking questions and prompting students' replies with cues are strategies that come naturally to most teachers. In fact, some 80 percent of student-teacher interactions involve cues and questions (Marzano, Pickering, &amp; Pollock, 2001). <span class="origunder">By fine-tuning questioning strategies with insights from research, teachers can become even more effective at guiding students' learning.</span>
        </p>
        <p align="left">
          <img src="images/picture.gif" width="153" height="117" align="right">Like questions, <span class="origunder">advance organizers are also commonly used to help set the stage for instruction.</span> Since David Ausubel (1960) first described advance organizers as a cognitive strategy to help students learn and retain information, teachers have developed a variety of forms for effectively organizing learning. The <span class="origunder">K-W-L chart</span>, for example, lists what students know, what they want to find out, and what they have learned (Ogle, 1986). <span class="origunder">Graphic organizers show how new ideas or concepts relate</span>, providing students with a visual framework for acquiring and organizing new information.

        <p>
          <span class="redbold">Pace yourself.</span> Teachers commonly underestimate how often they ask questions in class. Use questions to help students focus on what is more important to learn. <span class="origunder">Remember to ask questions when you introduce new content, and not just at the end of a learning experience</span>. Asking questions will not only tell you what students already know, but also whether they are starting with misunderstandings about a topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="redbold">Ask higher-level questions.</span> Think about how to phrase questions. By <span class="origunder">asking questions that require analysis,</span> you prompt students to go beyond simple recall of information and help to develop their <span class="origunder">higher-order thinking skills.</span>

        <p>
          <span class="redbold"><img src="images/teacher2.jpg" width="129" height="92" align="left">Wait time matters.</span> Give students time to think before jumping in with an answer to your own question. <span class="origunder">Pausing for just a few seconds</span> is likely to generate better classroom discourse, including more conversation among students.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="redbold">Preview the big picture.</span> Help students see where you are going by giving them an overview of what a lesson or unit will cover.

          Bloom has created a taxonomy of thinking levels. Take a look at the verbs that are associated with each level of thinking. It is important to balance your questioning with questions from ALL areas and require students to constantly flex their brains for successful learning. Below is a Hyperlink to various forms of Bloom's Taxonomy charts from which to choose.
