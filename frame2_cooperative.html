                    on Effectiveness: Cooperative Grouping</p>
                  <p align="LEFT">Cooperative learning 
                    is actually a generic term that refers to numerous methods for grouping students. 
                    At least 10 different methods have been formally described in the research literature. 
                    Therefore, "cooperative learning" as a strategy, requires a closer look to take 
                    advantage of potential benefits for learners. </p>
                  <p align="LEFT">Effective cooperative 
                    learning occurs when students work together to accomplish shared goals and when 
                    positive structures are in place to support that process (Johnson & Johnson, 1999). </p>
                  <p align="LEFT">Even though appropriate use of student groups for learning 
                    has been shown to yield significant learning improvement across disciplines, the 
                    successful application of cooperative grouping in classrooms still eludes many 
                    educators (Johnson & Johnson). </p>

                    Teachers who are successful at<b> facilitating cooperative learning</b> employ 
                    research-based strategies, such as: </p>
                  <p align="LEFT"><span class="origunder">Create 
                    the right type of group for the need.</span> Sometimes an occasional informal 
                    ad hoc group is needed, such as pair and share. Base groups are formed for long-term 
                    social and interpersonal support. Formal learning groups are used when a commitment 
                    of time and effort is required. </p>
                  <p> <span class="origunder">Keep group size 
                    small.</span> Ideally, learning groups include no more than four students. Consider 
                    tasks and equipment that is required to be used by each students. And don't forget 
                    TIME on TASK. Groups of two or three are ideal. Base groups may be larger, up 
                    to six students.
                  
                  <p> <span class="origunder">Use ability grouping sparingly.</span> Students across the spectrum of abilities benefit by heterogeneous grouping, especially 
                    low-ability students.
                  
                  <p> <span class="origunder">Don't use cooperative learning 
                    for all instructional goals.</span> While cooperative learning is a powerful strategy, 
                    it can be overused, or misapplied. Students need time to investigate ideas and 
                    pursue interests on their own.
                  
                  <p><span class="origunder">Use a variety of strategies 
                    when choosing students for groups.</span> Many selection strategies (common clothing, 
                    favorite colors, letters in names, birthdays) will work when attempting to <b>randomly</b> group students.

                    learning journals, and other structuring documents that foster the smooth processes 
                    needed for effective cooperation and group work. Use online tools for ubiquitous 
                    access to forms.
