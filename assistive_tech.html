        <h3>WELCOME to the online module for ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY! </h3>
        <p>
          During this module, you will learn about legal mandates and guidelines that govern the use of Assistive Technology (AT) to students with disabilities in the public school. 
        </p>
        <p>
          During this session, you will be directed to the Texas Assistive Technology Network website to download important information. This is a valuable website that has been developed for teacher training on this very topic: <a href="http://www.texasat.net">www.texasat.net</a> bookmark this website! 
        </p>
        <p>
          During this module you will go to this website and print out Assistive Technology Resource Charts for your teacher notebook. You will also find additional resources on AT that may be very valuable to you as you enter the profession. Print out materials and resources to have them at your fingertips when needed. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You will need to complete the activity pages as you go through the session. These notes will serve as a reminder of the material covered and you will add them to your Special Education notebook to show to your instructor on the first night of face to face classes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Go ahead, take a few minutes to look over Competency 004 from the Special Education TExES exam. You will be tested over this information on your TExES exam.</p>

        <h2>What is Assistive Technology?</h2>
        <p>
          <h3 id="accordionheader">Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</h3>

          <p>
            IDEA is a federal statute that protects the rights of students with disabilities and mandates that they receive a free and appropriate public education.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="origunder">Assistive Technology device</span> <b>means any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized that is used to increase, maintain or improve the functional capabilities of a child with a disability. The term does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted or the replacement of that device. </b>
        </p>
        <p class="origunder">What makes an item <span class="redbold">AT</span> is whether that item is required in order to assure that the student to receive a free, appropriate, public education (FAPE). 
        </p>
        <p>
          AT must be an item or a thing...a person, perhaps an assistant that acts as a note taker is NEVER <span class="redbold">AT</span>. 
        </p>
        <p>
          A wide range of services can be considered <span class="redbold">AT</span> services; all of which relate to supporting the student. The congressional intent of IDEA 2004 makes it clear that<span class="origunder"> members of the IEP team must consider the student's need for AT to support educational achievement.</span> This is the responsibility of the decision making team, or ARD committee. Law requires that accessible instructional materials are available to all students. 
        </p>

        <h2>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act:</h2>
        <p>Section 504 protects individuals who: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Have physical or mental impairments which substantially limit a major life activity, </li>
          <li>Have a history of such impairment, or </li>
          <li>Are regarded as having such an impairment. </li>
        </ol>
       <p>
        This statute mandates that any program that receives federal financial assistance <span class="origunder">must provide</span> each student with a disability the special education and <span class="origunder">related aids and services</span> that constitute a free appropriate education for that student. Since public schools receive federal funding, they are subject to the requirements of this statute.

        <h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA):</h2>
        <p>
          ADA prohibits any governmental entity from denying access to individuals with a disability and requires that auxiliary aids and services be provided. Children with disabilities who attend public school are protected by the ADA as individuals who are participating in programs or are using services provided by governmental entities. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to federal statues and regulations related to AT, <strong>school districts in Texas</strong> must also comply with <strong>provisions in Texas law</strong> requiring services to eligible students:

        <h2>Texas Education Code and Texas Administrative Code</h2>
        <p>
          The definition of AT is very broad and you can see that a wide range of items may fall in this category. This is where a classification system comes in handy!
        </p>
        <p> 
          Many times when people think of technology, they think of high tech products, such as computers and high tech communication aids - but actually, there is a broad continuum from no tech/low tech to very complex high tech.

              These items have a degree of electronic functioning and almost always have some sort of power source that requires some level of care. These devices are potentially very powerful, but for many users, often require less training and support to get started.

        When looking at all the definitions and federal statutes, you can see that school districts have numerous responsibilities under federal statute and Texas code.
    <p>
      <b>Below is a summarized list of the most basic responsibilities of a school district when it comes to <span class="redbold">AT</span>:</b>
    </p>
    <h3 id="accordionheader">
      Each school district:
    </h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Must consider the potential <span class="redbold">AT</span> needs of the student</li>
      <li>Must determine if <span class="redbold">AT</span> evaluation is necessary</li>
      <li>If necessary, must complete the <span class="redbold">AT</span> evaluation</li>
      <li>If necessary, <span class="redbold">AT</span> must be written in the Individual Education Plan (IEP)</li>
      <li>Must implement the provision of the AT device and /or <span class="redbold">AT</span> services indicated in IEP</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These obligations have led to a significant number of legal challenges regarding the provision of <span class="redbold">AT</span> and <span class="redbold">AT</span> services because of the broad definition. <span class="redbold">Texas has created a 4 step model</span> to guide you through responsive and responsible decision making based on the student's needs, abilities, and educational program.

                 <p>
                  It is always important to look at how the student is currently functioning and important to note whether or not the student has been using AT as an accommodation to get to their present level. It is critical to begin thinking about if and how the technology might be included in the student's program to support increases in their educational performance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this stage, members of the evaluation team may offer evaluation data that can provide critical information that will be of significant use in making determination about AT.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, if data is presented that indicates the student has difficulty seeing the text of less than a certain size, it would be important to think about how AT can make all the text accessible to the student.

                  During this step, committee members must keep in mind that the goals and objectives need to be aimed toward what the student needs to be able to learn and do to participate in and benefit from the educational process, NOT what the student is able to do at the time the goals and objectives are being developed. High expectations, student progress, and student achievement are focal points of the special education process and goals and objectives must reflect these expectations.

                <p>
                  It is important to the committee to determine what specific tasks the student must be able to do to work toward mastery of the goals and objectives. The committee needs to consider what is happening in the classroom and other environments that enable students to make educational progress. In each educational environment, there are tasks that students need to be able to do in order to participate actively. Committee members will need to think about whether or not the core instructional materials used during these tasks are readily accessible for the student, or if the student will need AT to access the material.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When thinking about required tasks, the committee will examine instructional and functional skills that are pertinent to the student's tasks in the current learning environments and think about how the specific needs of the student will impact the student's performance of those tasks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Think about how technology might support or supplement needed skills that are of concern so that learning tasks can be addressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Georgia Project for Assistive Technology (GPAT) has developed a document which lists samples of functional tasks required in school such as writing, reading, etc, and provides examples of common standard classroom tools, modifications and accommodations of tasks and expectations, and possible AT solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Go to the Texas Assistive Technology Network (TATN) - <a href="http://www.texasat.net">www.texasat.net</a> - and browse through all the training modules (across the top) they have available regarding AT in the classroom.

                  While you are there, click on the "Consideration Module" - then "Participant Materials - Resource Guide" at the bottom of the page. This document will be a helpful overview of considering AT during the ARD process. <b>Print out pages 12-19 for your notebook.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the team identifies tasks in the instructional / functional skills area that are of concern, they begin to think about the supports and services - including AT devices and services - which would be included in the student's education program to support growth and learning.

                  Decide whether or not AT devices and services are needed and document decisions.

                  Finally, in step 4, the committee members decide whether or not AT devices and services are required for the student to make progress in the education program that has been developed. Team members come to one of three possible conclusions:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="origunder">AT is not needed:</span> - Data collected that supports that AT is not needed at this time needs to be documented in the student's paperwork. Just because it is not needed at this time, does not mean it will not be needed in the future. AT should be considered at every committee meeting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="origunder">AT is needed:</span> The Committee has decided that the student will not be able to make reasonable progress in the educational program without the use of AT devices and / or support of AT services. Specific devices and services that are needed are recorded and documented in the student's paperwork.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <span class="origunder">More information is needed:</span> If the committee determines that they need additional assistance and information in making the determination of need for AT services, the committee documents the type of assistance that is needed and a timeline for seeking out such services.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When deciding whether or not AT is needed, there are several questions that may be helpful to ask:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
                    <ol>
                      <li>If the student is currently using <b>AT</b>, is the <b>AT</b> adequate to address the new goals and objectives?
                      </li>
                      <li>Does the student need <b>AT</b> to access the curriculum?
                      </li>
                      <li>Does the student need <b>AT</b> to access instructional materials?
                      </li>
                      <li>Does the student need <b>AT</b> to access the technology used by other students?
                      </li>
                      <li>Could <b>AT</b> help the student work more independently?
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                      &nbsp;
                    </p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  As team members consider the student's AT needs, they ask themselves whether technology would enable the student to work more <span class="origunder">independently</span>, more <span class="origunder">effectively</span>, or more <span class="origunder">efficiently</span>.
                </p>
                <div class="panel" id="redpanel">
                  <p>
                    It is very important to stress that whatever decision is reached, it applies <span class="origunder">AT THIS TIME.</span> Consideration is an ongoing process that can be revisited at any point that there is reason to think it should be. <span class="origunder">An Assistive Technology consideration decision is never permanent</span>. It is based on the needs of the student in relation to his education goals, objectives, and tasks at the present time and revised as needed.

                  In order to add resources to your Special Education notebook, watch this video clip of references that students found simply by doing an internet search. You will want to take notes on the Video Clip page and include it in your Special Education notebook!
                </p>
                <p>
                  As you can see there is quiet a bit of technology available to help students be successful. Sometimes all it takes is a little leg work to find the appropriate tools!
